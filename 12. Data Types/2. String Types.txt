The most common
	CHAR(x)
		fix-length strings
			
			we use them to store numeric values, like
				zip code
				phone numbers
					because we don't use these values in mathematical operations
			
	VARCHAR(x)
		max 65.535 (~64KB)
			(50)
				username
				password
			(255)
		
			for medium-legth strings	
				if store something that is longer 
					we will get truncated
						to prevent that 
							we can use*
	
	*MEDIUMTEXT
		max: 16 mb 
	
			which allows us to store roughly up to 16 million characters
				This is good for storing 
					json objects
					cs view string
					
	LONGTEXT
		max: 4 GB
			for storing 
				book 
				years of log files
				
	--------
	TINYTEXT
		max: 255 bytes (charecters)
		
	TEXT
		max: to 65.000(64kb) characters just like varchar
		
		But for this range of characters it's better to use
			the VARCHAR type
				because it can be 
					indexed
						Basically to understand
							we use indexes to speed our query, we will talk about later
							
							
								Bytes
	Englisch languages 			1	
		if the varchar(10)			column = 10 bytes
	European Middle-eastern		2
	Asian 						3
		if the varchar(10)			column = 30 bytes
