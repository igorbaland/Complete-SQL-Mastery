Enums
	there are times that we want to restrict the values for a column
		to a limited list of strings
		
	For example, we might have a column called size
		and in this column, we only want to allow the values
			small
			medium
			large
			
ENUM('small', 'medium', 'large')
-- similar to enum 
SET(...)
	can store multiple values
		we specify the list of allowable values, and the we can store multiple values
			in a column. 

Enums are in my opinion
	generally bad and we should avoid them
		1. The first reason is changing the members of an enum can be expensive.
			For example, let's say tomorrow we decide to come back to our products
			table and add a new member (.., ..., +) or rename
				MySQL is going to rebuild this entire table
					and this can be expensive if we have a millions of records in this table.
				Also with this approach we can add a dditional attributes to each member. 
					For example, what  if we want to include the actual measurements for each size?
						We can do that. 
				Also, if we want to get the list of all possible sizes 
					and display them in a drop down list in our application, 
						we have to do a bit more work, it's not that easy. 
				Plus these enums are not reuseable, so if we have another table
					and we want to reuse these values there. 
					In that table we need to redefine that enum with these members
					and that duplication means if we decide to make a change in one of these members
					we will have to apply the change in multiple places.
					
				These are some of the reasons I believe enums are bad, and we should avoid them.
			
A better approach is to have a separate table called sizes. 
	In this table, we can store all the sizes
		and any additional attributes they have like their measurement. 
			We can reuse this table in multiple places and
				if we want to get all the sizes,
					we write a single select statement, it's really easy.
	We refer to this kind of a table as a 
		lookup table.
