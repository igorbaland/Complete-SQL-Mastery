Rationals
	for storing numbers with a decimal point

DECIMLA(p, s)
	useful for storing fixed-point numbers
		these are numbers that have a fixed number of digits
			after the decimal point 
				like monetary values
				
	When we using the decimal type
		we need to suppl two arguments:
			- precision
				precision specify the maximum number of digits
				and this can be between
					1-65
			- scale
				determines the number of digits after the decimal point
		
				For example, with a decimal of 9 of 2, we can store a number with maximum
				of 9 digits, we have two digets after, and 7 digits before the decimal point.

Also this decimal type has a few synonyms,
	they are dec numeric and fixed

DEC

NUMERIC

FIXED
-----
we also have

FLOAT
	4b
	
DOUBLE
	8b

these are used in scientific calculations. If we want to perform calculations
	with very large of very small numbers, we should use these types
	
	Just remember these types don't store the exact values
		they use an approximation
			that's the reason they allow us to store really large or really small numbers
______________			
If we want to work with exact values like monetary value
	we should use 
		DECIMAL type

If we want to work with really large or small numbers in scientific calculations 
	and the precision is not important
		we should use 
			FLOAT
			DOUBLE
