DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS payments_after_insert;

as the best practice, we should have drop and create in one script file.
like this:

DELIMITER $$

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS payments_after_insert;

CREATE TRIGGER payments_after_insert
	-- BEFORE, UPDATE/DELETE
	AFTER INSERT ON payments
    FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN
	UPDATE invoices
										-- OLD
    SET payment_total = payment_total + NEW.amount
    WHERE invoice_id = NEW.invoice_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
