A trigger is a block of SQL code that automatically gets executed before or after an insert, update or delete statement.
Quite often, we use triggers to enforce data consistency.
For example:
	in our sql store database, we can have multiple payments towards a given invoice. 
	Whenever we insert a new record in the payment table, we should make sure that the payment_total column i the invoice table
		gets updated
			And this is where we use the a trigger



-- create trigger
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER payments_after_insert
	-- BEFORE, UPDATE/DELETE
	AFTER INSERT ON payments
    FOR EACH ROW 
BEGIN
	UPDATE invoices
					-- OLD
    SET payment_total = payment_total + NEW.amount
    WHERE invoice_id = NEW.invoice_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;


-- test trigger
INSERT INTO payments
VALUES (DEFAULT, 5, 3, '2019-01-01', 10, 1)






------------------
-- delete trigger
DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER payments_after_delete
	AFTER DELETE ON payments
    FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN 
	UPDATE invoices
    SET payment_total = payment_total - OLD.amount
    WHERE invoice_id = OLD.invoice_id;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

--test
SELECT * FROM sql_invoicing.payments;

DELETE
FROM payments
WHERE payment_id = 10
