-- Select clients that have an invoice

-- 1.
SELECT *
FROM clients
WHERE  client_id IN (
	SELECT DISTINCT client_id
    From invoices
)
	-- what if in this table 
		100, 1000 or 1 kk id's, that have an invoice
			we are going end with a very, very large list
				And this will have negative impact on the performance
					In situations like this it is more efficient to use 
						EXISTS operator




-- 2. using the EXISTS Operator 
SELECT *
FROM clients c
WHERE EXISTS (
	SELECT client_id
    FROM invoices
    WHERE client_id = c.client_id
)

	-- when we use the EXISTS operator
		the subquery doesn't actually return a result to the outer query.
			Instead it will return an indication of wheter any rows in subquery matches
			these search condition


-- Find the products that have never been ordered
USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
	SELECT product_id
    FROM order_items
    WHERE product_id = p.product_id
)
