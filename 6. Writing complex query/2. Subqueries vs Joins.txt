SELECT *
FROM clients
WHERE client_id NOT IN (
	SELECT DISTINCT client_id
    FROM invoices
)

SELECT *
FROM clients
LEFT JOIN invoices USING (client_id)
WHERE invoice_id IS NULL


Performance and readability
	assume both these queries have the same exucution time,
		we should go for a query that is most readable
			In this example, the first is better readable
	

-- Subqueries	
USE sql_store;

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN(
	SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN orders o USING(order_id)
    WHERE product_id = 3
)

-- join
USE sql_store;

SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customers
JOIN orders o USING (customer_id)
JOIN order_items oi USING (order_id)
WHERE oi.product_id = 3
