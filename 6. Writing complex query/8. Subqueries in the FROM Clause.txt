-- we can get this table in memory and treat it like a real table in our database
	We can join it with another table using the client 
	
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT
		client_id,
		name,
		(SELECT SUM(invoice_total)
			FROM invoices
			WHERE client_id = c.client_id) AS total_sales,
		(SELECT AVG (invoice_total) FROM invoices) AS average,
		(SELECT total_sales - average) AS difference
	FROM clients c
) AS sales_summary
WHERE total_sales IS NOT NULL
