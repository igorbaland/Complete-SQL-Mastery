SQL Statements
	We are not going to write them in our application code for a couple reasons
		- it will make our application code messy and hard to maintain
			for example, when we are building our application with java
				we don't want to mix our Java code with SQL
					- code messy
					- hard maintain
					- recompile code (java, if we have some changes in sql)
			- for these reasons, we should take our SQL code of our application code
				and store it in a database where it belongs
				
Stored Procedure/Function
	- store and organize SQL
	- faster execution
	- Data security
