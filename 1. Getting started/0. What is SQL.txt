Database is a collection of data stored in a format
	that can easily be accessed 
	
We use a software application called database management systems
	DBMS
		we connect to DBMS and give it 
			instructions for 
				querying ormodifaction data.
				
				The DBMS will execute our instructions and 
					send result back

We have several DBMS, these are clasified into two categories
	1.
	realational
		we store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships
		
		SQL is the language that we use to work with these relational database management system RDBMS
			we use SQL
				to query or modify our data
	
	2.
	NoSQL(non-relational)
		we don't have 
			tables or relationships. These databases is very different from relationshiop
			
			Note: NoSQL DBMS doesn't understand SQL. They have each own query language

		has a different flayer of managin sql,
