CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
SELECT
	invoice_id,
    number,
    client_id,
    invoice_total,
    payment_total,
    invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
    invoice_date,
    due_date,
    payment_date
FROM invoices
WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total) > 0



SELECT * FROM sql_invoicing.invoices_with_balance;




DELETE FROM invoices_with_balance
WHERE invoice_id = 1



UPDATE invoices_with_balance
SET due_date = DATE_ADD(due_date, INTERVAL 2 DAY)
WHERE invoice_id = 2


We can also insert data, 
	but not always we have permissions between multiple tables
