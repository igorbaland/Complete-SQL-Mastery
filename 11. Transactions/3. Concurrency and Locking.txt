In the real world it's quite possible that two or more users may try to access the same data at the same time.
	This is what we call concurrency

	Concurrency can become a problem when one user modifies the data 
		that other users are trying to retrieve or modify. 

How MySQL handles concurrency by default
Simulate 2 users are trying to update the points for a given customer at the same time

MySQL Workbrench
	open a new connection
		now we have 2 seperate connections or sessions

1. Session
USE sql_store;
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers
SET points = points + 10
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;

2. Session
USE sql_store;
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE customers
SET points = points + 10
WHERE customer_id = 1;
COMMIT;

	execute scripts line by line
		1. Session
		2. Session
			QueryNameView is running
				Lost connection to MySQL server during query	

		If another transaction tries to update the same row 
			it has to wait until the first transaction is complete. 
				Either commited or ruled out
