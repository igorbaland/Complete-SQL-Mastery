A group of SQL statements that represent a single

All the statements should be completed successfully or the transaction will fail.
Example bank transaction
	When we transef  10 dollars from our account to our friends account,
		10 dollars should be taken out of our account
			and deposit it into our friends account

	So we have two operations and this two operations together represent 

		a single unit of work


	Either both these operations should complete sucessfully
		or if the first operation suceeds 
			but the second operation failed

				we need to roll back or revert the changes by the first operation


We use transaction in situation, where we want to make multiple changes to a database
	and we want all these changes to succeed or fail together as 
		a single unit


Let's say we want to store an order with an item in our database, we need two SQL statements to store this order
What if INSERT the order record
	but the server crashes at the time we are going to insert ther order item
		We will end up with an incomplete order
			and our databasewill not be in a consistent state.


ACID properties
	
	Atomicity, 
		our transactions are like atoms, they are unbreakable. 
		Each transaction is a single unit of work 
			no matter how many statements it's contains
		Either  all this statements get executed sucessfully and the transaction is comitted or
			the transaction is rolled back and all these changes are undone

	Consistency, 
		with this transactions, our database will always remain in a consistent state.
			We don't end up with an order without item

	Isolation,
		these transactions are isolated or protected from each other
			if they tried to modify the same data
		They cannot interfare with each other
		If multiple transactionss try to update the same data,
			the rows that are being affected get locked, so only one transaction at a time
				can update those rows, other transactions have to wait for that transaction to complete.  

	Durability
		once a transaction is commited the changes made by the transaction are permanent
			if we have a failure or a system crash, we are not going to lose the system changes
