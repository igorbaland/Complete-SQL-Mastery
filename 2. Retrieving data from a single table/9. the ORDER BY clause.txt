Why sql sort by id by default
	customers table > click on tool icon
		icon yellow key before customer_id
			primary key column
			
-- in ascending order			
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	ORDER BY first_name

-- in descending order DESC
	SELECT *
	FROM customers
	ORDER BY first_name DESC

-- if we have duplicate for example state, and 2x customers from the same state. 
	first sort by state and than by first_name
	
		SELECT *
		FROM customers
		ORDER BY state, first_name

SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state DESC, first_name

#worst practice
	SELECT first_name, last_name, 10 AS points
	FROM customers
	ORDER BY 1, 2
	
#duplicate
	SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
	FROM sql_store.order_items
	WHERE order_id = 2
	ORDER BY quantity * unit_price DESC
	
	-- better way
		SELECT *, quantity * unit_price AS total_price
		FROM sql_store.order_items
		WHERE order_id = 2
		ORDER BY total_price DESC
