we use cross joins to combine or join every record 
	from the first table with every record in the second table

-- explicit
-- better way, clear
SELECT 
	c.first_name AS customer,
    p.name AS product
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN products p
ORDER BY c.first_name
	
	-- implicit
	-- the same way, but doesn't clear, 
	SELECT 
		c.first_name AS customer,
		p.name AS product
	FROM customers c, orders o
	ORDER BY c.first_name	
	
-- implicit
SELECT *
FROM shippers s, products p

-- explicit
SELECT *
FROM shippers s
CROSS JOIN products p	


CROSS JOIN, real example for using
	where we have a table of sizes like small, medium, large
		and a table of colors like red, blue, green... and we want to combine all the sizes
			to all the colors.
				That is when we use a cross join
