-- implicit join syntax, better way
SELECT *
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
	ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
	
	
-- across join, worst way
SELECT *
FROM orders o, customers c
WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
	-- let's say, we have forget to type where clause
	-- we get all records from customer and order table
	
	-- this is what we call 
		across join
